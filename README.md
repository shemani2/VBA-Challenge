# VBA-Challenge

In this challenge, the script and screenshots per year are attached.

The excel file was too big to attach therefore the code has been added as a separate visual basic code file. 

After writing and running the code, I had trouble and got help from the TA Sunil Khambaita who shared this file: https://smuvirtdatapt-l6a5827.slack.com/files/U06DBU4EHK3/F06CX2X14JH/screenshot_2024-01-08_at_11.05.33_pm.png

Found another source to help me compare and contrast my own code. After running the code a few times, I changed my code to reflect a similar approach to this one: https://github.com/shrawantee/VBA-Scripting---Stock-Market-Analysis/blob/master/HW2_Hard_DS.vbs
